## Essential Go Commands for DevOps

Here are some key Go commands and their purposes, especially useful for DevOps workflows:

| **Command**               | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `go mod init <name>`       | Initializes a Go module (creates `go.mod`).                                 |
| `go.mod`                   | Stores project details and dependencies.                                    |
| `go get <package>`         | Downloads a dependency and updates `go.mod`.                                |
| `go.sum`                   | Security file that verifies dependency integrity.                           |
| `go mod tidy`              | Removes unused dependencies and fixes missing ones.                         |
| `go run <file.go>`         | Runs the Go program.                                                        |
| `go build <file.go>`       | Compiles the Go program into an executable binary.                          |
| `go test`                  | Runs tests in the current directory.                                        |
| `go fmt <file.go>`         | Formats the Go code to adhere to standard conventions.                      |

## How to Use This Repository

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mehboobpatel/Go-Lang-ForDevOps
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Go-Lang-ForDevOps
```

Initialize your WorkDir

```bash
go mod init <yourprojectname>
```
- This will generate go.mod

To Download any Additional package 
```bash
go get k8s.io/client-go@latest
```
- This will generate go.sum

If your code imports a package that is not in go.mod, it adds it and updates go.sum.
If your go.mod file contains imports that are no longer used, it removes them from go.mod and go.sum
```bash
go mod tidy
```

To print a helloworld with your name as input  
```bash
go run helloworld.go Maheboob
```

To compile into an executable binary:

```bash
go build helloworld.go 
./helloworld Maheboob
```

To fetch & read data from an API and processes it.
```bash
go run readapi.go
```


To read a file.
```bash
go run readconfigfile.go
```

To Interact with Kubernetes & List with resources
```bash
go run showk8sresrc.go
```
